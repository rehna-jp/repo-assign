## Mini Java Projects - Projects For New Developers and Advanced developers

Welcome to the **Assignments** repository! This repository contains a collection of small, educational Java projects developed using either **NetBeans** or **VS Code**. The purpose of these projects is to help developers, especially beginners, learn core Java concepts through practical examples.

## Projects in This Repository
Hereâ€™s a list of some of the projects currently available:

- **Bank**: Optimized banking system with trailing space fixes.
- **CirclePr**: Includes minor changes for a circle perimeter calculator.
- **Emolument**: Contains a package that calculates emoluments.
- **Hypo**: An updated hypotenuse calculator with comments for better understanding.
- **ManagementPURC**: A simple bill calculator program.
- **Pop-Ups**: Demonstrates popup usage in Java GUI using JOptionPane.
- **ShoppingCart**: A simple shopping cart system for learning purposes.

Feel free to explore each project folder and check out the Java files to understand how they work.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Java (currently, but other languages may be added in the future)
- **IDE**: Primarily developed in **VS Code**, but **NetBeans** can also be used.

### VS Code Extensions:
To run these projects effectively in VS Code, make sure you have the following extensions installed:
- Java Extension Pack
- Debugger for Java
- Maven for Java (if applicable)

## Contributions
This repository is open-source, and contributions are welcome! 

When contributing:
- Please include a `Projects INSTRUCTIONS.md` file in your project folder.
- The `Projects INSTRUCTIONS.md` should list the technologies used and provide detailed instructions on how to modify the source code.
- Comments should be clear and precise and methods should be declared using camel casing eg. `myName`, `firstNumber`, `isMoving`.
- In case variables like `int x;`, `String n;` or `boolean b;` is used, comments should be added to explain what the variable represents.
